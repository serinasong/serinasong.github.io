    <div class="rr" id="rr1">This article provides me with a new perspective on Mail Art: Mail Art is not a solo art form; to be precise, it is art utilizing mail as a medium to convey ideas and thoughts. As Ulises Carri√≥n, the author, mentioned back in 1979, it was not cheap to send out mails. Yet, a mail artist does not become an artist when they only send out a single piece of mail. Things have become vastly different compared to nowadays; artists can produce one piece of art in digital format or any other format, post it online, and the existence of the art piece is always there, being broadcasted.

        While reading the article, a few questions come to mind: How do people define a thing as art? Back in those days, it was expensive to practice art via mail. However, as mail becomes cheaper, there are barely any new artists who consider themselves mail artists. When an art piece becomes ubiquitous, is it still art? Similarly, does art have a lifespan?</div>
